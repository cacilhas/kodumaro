:first Now I‚Äôm revisiting an [old post of mine][] about my personal impressions
about the [Go][] language.

### Outflanking

My first impression on Go was very wrong. I flanked Go from the [Python][] and
[Node.js][] perspective, which was very disappointing. When you try to use a
language that offers powerful tools to access system resources with an
open-and-shut mind, the result is frustrating.

As soon as I understood Go is closer to [C++][] and [Objective-C][], I realised
it‚Äôs a cool, powerful, and fun programming language.

At that time, a friend vainly tried to explain me Go pointers as read-write
parameters against read-only ones. If he had simply told me ‚Äúpointers like in
C,‚Äù I‚Äôd get at once.

My disapproval to Go is that [Alphabet][] might not have recreated the
wheel so hard, it could take advantage of other well-tested platforms, like
[Vala][] and [C‚ôØ][] did. It would entice lotta god programmers by the soft
learning curve (despite [Linus Tovarlds disagrees][]).

### Interfaces

In Go, [interfaces][] look like [structural types][] in Scala.

In other hand, [structs][] are much like
[Objective-C `@interface`s][objc-interface].

An instance of any struct that matches an interface is instance of the
inteface too, just like structural types.

For sample, take the following interface:

```go
type Person interface {
  FirstName() string
  LastName() string
  FullName() string
  Birth() time.Time
}
```

If one has defined a struct:

```go
type personType struct {
  firstName, lastName string
  birth               time.Time
}
```

And then every function from `Person` is implemented for `personType`:

```go
func (p personType) FirstName() string {
  return p.firstName
}

func (p personType) LastName() string {
  return p.lastName
}

func (p personType) FullName() string {
  return strings.Trim(fmt.Sprintf("%v %v", p.firstName, p.lastName), " ")
}

func (p personType) Birth() time.Time {
  return p.birth
}
```

Then it‚Äôs possible to return a `personType` as `Person`:

```go
func NewPerson(firstName, lastName string, birth time.Time) Person {
  return personType{firstName, lastName, birth}
}
```

### Unit tests

For testing, Go‚Äôs got a built-in [testing][] library, that‚Äôs very easy to
use.

Being very verbose, a yet simple example may be:

```go
func TestPerson(t *testing.T) {
  timeForm := "2006-01-02"
  birth, _ := time.Parse(timeForm, "2017-06-12")
  p := NewPerson("John", "Doe", birth)

  t.Run("primary methods", func(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("FirstName", func(t *test.T) {
      if got := p.FirstName(); got != "John" {
        t.Fatalf("expected John, got %v", got)
      }
    })

    t.Run("LastName", func(t *test.T) {
      if got := p.LastName(); got != "Doe" {
        t.Fatalf("expected Doe, got %v", got)
      }
    })

    t.Run("Birth", func(t *test.T) {
      expected, _ := time.Parse(timeForm, "2017-02-12")
      if got := p.Birth(); got != expected {
        t.Fatalf("expected %v, got %v", expected, got)
      }
    })
  })

  t.Run("secondary methods", func(t *test.T) {
    t.Run("FullName", func(t *test.T) {
      if got := p.FullName(); got != "John Doe" {
        t.Fatalf("expected John Doe, got %v", got)
      }
    })
  })
}
```

Enough for most cases.

:small In order to understand Go time format: [Format a time or date][].

### Catching exceptions

The Go‚Äôs exception catching pattern is returning the error as second argument
for every function that can go wrong.

In the sample above, one can found this line:

```go
birth, _ := time.Parse(timeForm, "2017-06-12")
```

The underscore (`_`) means the exception is discarded. If one wanna deal with
the exception, one can do something like:

```go
birth, err := time.Parse(timeForm, "2017-06-12")
if err != nil {
  // Deal with the exception
  ...
}
```

Another way Go can throw an exception is by a panic attack. One can do it by
calling the `panic()` function.

The only way to catch this kind of exception is calling `recover()` inside a
`defer` block.

One can catch the exception and return it through a writable channel (`chan` or
`chan<-`).

It smells like:

```go
func DoSomethingDangerous(res chan<- error) {
  defer res <- recover()

  // Do somenthing that can raise a panic attack.
  ...
}
```
