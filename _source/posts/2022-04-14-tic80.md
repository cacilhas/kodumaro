{:class="mg-first"} [TIC-80][] is a free fantasy console for making, playing,
and sharing tiny games.

It has lots of built-in tools for development, like code, sprites, maps, sound
editors, a command line, and a Surf browser.

Its main development language is [Lua][], but it supports a bunch of other
languages too, such as [Moonscript][], [Javascript][], [Wren][], and
[Squirrel][].

> Talking about Wren by the way, you can check the amazing [Dome][] game
> engine.

Aiming to build a brief presentation, I’m coding a turning Yin-Yang symbol.

### Opening TIC-80

Once you open the application, you got the prompt:

```
TIC-80 tiny computer
version 1.0.2164 (b09c50c)
https://tic80.com (C) 2017-2022

hello! type help for help

>
```

Or something like this. In order to start a new project, use the `NEW` command,
informing the language you mean to use:

```
> NEW moon
new cart is created
```

### Coding headers and background

Now press `Escape` to enter the code editor. It starts with a boilerplate we
don’t need, let’s delete the code, keeping only the headers:

```moonscript
-- title:   game title
-- author:  game developer, email, etc.
-- desc:    short description
-- site:    website link
-- license: MIT License (change this to your license of choice)
-- version: 0.1
-- script:  moon
```

Update the headers to reflect our intension:

```moonscript
-- title:  Yin Yang
-- author: Kodumaro
-- script: moon
export ^
local  *
```

We’re gonna do some black magic hereafter… This code was taken from the
[TIC-80’s wiki][], and creates a beautiful blue background gradient:

```moonscript
BOOT=cls

BDR==>
 poke 0x3fc1,@
 poke 0x3fc2,@+100

TIC=->
```

The `BOOT` function is called only once, clearing the screen (`cls`).

**Note:** TIC-80 code cannot be larger than 65&#8239;536 characters, so avoid
unnecessary whitespaces.

If nothing is wrong, when you press ^^abbr(title="Control+R") C-r ^^, you’re
gonna get the following background:

{:class="text-center"} ![Sky Gradient](//cacilhas.info/img/tic80/sky-gradient.png)

In earlier versions, `Escape` leads you back to the prompt, `escape` again to
the code editor. From version 1.0, you must select `CLOSE GAME` in order to get
back:

{:class="text-center"} ![CLOSE GAME](//cacilhas.info/img/tic80/close-game.png)

### Creating the Yin-Yang symbol

Now we need to initialise the variables:

- `c` for the screen centre – TIC-8 resolution is 240×136
- `sin` and `cos` for the trigonometrical functions – taken from `math` package
- `pi` for  π – taken from `math` package
- `tau` for τ – calculated from `pi`
- `angle` to control the turning angle
- `rm` and `rM` for smaller and greater circle radii respectively
- `yin` and `yang` for the colours

In TIC-80, colours are stored in a palette, [defaults to][sweetie-16]:

{:class="text-center"} ![Sweetie-16](//cacilhas.info/img/tic80/sweetie-16.png)

So the variables are initialised:

```moonscript
import sin,cos,pi from math
c=x:120,y:68
tau=pi*2
angle=0
rm=3
rM=20
yin=15
yang=12
```

The following statements must be put inside the `TIC` function, ’cause they need
to run every tick.

The black eye centre is calculated as a 2D vector of the current angle, away
from the screen centre using the greater radius:

```moonscript
 c1=x:c.x+cos(angle)*rM,y:c.y+sin(angle)*rM
```

The white eye centre is 180° away from the other one:

```moonscript
 a2=angle+pi
```

And the centre is calculated from the angle `a2`:

```moonscript
  c2=x:c.x+cos(a2)*rM,y:c.y+sin(a2)*rM
```

Now we need to draw four circles:

1. A big dark one in `c1`
1. A big light one in `c2`
1. A small light one in `c1`
1. A small dark one in `c2`

Which, using the TIC-8 assets, is:

```moonscript
 circ c1.x,c1.y,rM,yin
 circ c2.x,c2.y,rM,yang
 circ c1.x,c1.y,rm,yang
 circ c2.x,c2.y,rm,yin
```

At the function end, the angle is updated by 180° a second – since TIC-80
framerate is 60Hz, 3° a tick:

```moonscript
 angle=(angle+pi/60)%tau
```

Running you must get the turning symbol:

{:class="text-center"} ![Sky Gradient](//cacilhas.info/img/tic80/yin-yang.png)
