{:class="mg-first"} Sometimes I spend some time trying to acquire new
programming skills, to finally figure out I was wasting time with something
useless.

But even well-known programming tools and languages have their own issues,
and this is why we hate them.


### Why we hate Python

[Python][python] is one of my favourite programming languages, but I haven‚Äôt
work with it for a while, and it isn‚Äôt for nothing.

Python is strongly typed, but also dynamically typed ‚Äì which wouldn‚Äôt be a
problem if it respected the assigned types, but you can assign an integer to a
variable and then assign a named tuple right after that.

[Erlang][erlang] has a very useful line: ‚Äú**fail fast and noisily**.‚Äù When
Python allows to change variable types, it potentially allows to carry errors
away from where they were caused too, which is the **worse** situation in a
debug.


### Why we hate Ruby

[Ruby][ruby] is one of the most beloved toy programming languages, mainly
because it makes bad programmers to look cool. Everything wrong you can imagine
in programming, you can find in Ruby.

Ruby falls in the same Python‚Äôs typing issues. It also promotes monkey-patch,
code injection, assets‚Äô implicit exportation, and tool monopoly. It‚Äôs nearly
impossible to track down where a bad behaviour comes from.

You might call Ruby a debugging hell.

However, it‚Äôs great for PoC.


### Why we hate Java

[Java][java] is the big static companies‚Äô darling.

Unlike Python and Ruby, Java is statically typed, and you need to cary errors
explicitly if you don‚Äôt want them to explode right where they arise.

Still, Java is extremely bureaucratic though, the simplest procedure is hard to
be done and requires many code statements.

Besides, Java is very greedy, consuming every hardware resource it can take.


### Why we hate Scala

The worst flaw of [Scala][scala] is not to be [Dotty][dotty]. Every nice and
useful feature you expect from an impure functional programming language, you
get from Scala.

However, Scala compiles to JVM bytecodes üòñ ‚Äì and this is enough reason not to
use it.

One can say you could do [Scala Native][scala-native], but that‚Äôs a hell you
don‚Äôt wanna get in ‚Äì believe me.


### Why we hate OCaml

[OCaml][ocaml] is the perfect impure functional programming language, except
for requiring widely long boilerplates to work.

The simpler project is more bureaucratic than Java, and you can get into a hell
of cyclical references too soon.


### Why we hate Standard ML

An alternative to OCaml is its grandpa, [Standard ML][mlton], which doesn‚Äôt
have the OCaml‚Äôs same issues.

But Standard ML has another one, very annoying: lack of tools.

You can find libraries for almost everything you need in OCaml, and what you
can‚Äôt find, you can bind from C. Standard ML is way poorer on libraries, and you
can get in trouble missing something very easily.


### Why we hate C/C++

C and [C++][c++] are great programming languages, so great that lots of other
programming languages are built on top of them. Everything you need, you can
find or build in C/C++.

But C is much too verbose, everything is taugh to get done, C++ is a pitfall of
infinite tokens, and both have unexpected behaviour. Don‚Äôt get me wrong! C/C++
are very stable, but they simply don‚Äôt behave like you may expect.

The better description for those languages could be: C/C++ do exactly what you
ask, not what you want.


### Why we hate Julia

Regarding [Julia][julia], I think we don‚Äôt need to go further than this:

What to expect from a programming language that, when you assign a value to a
constant, raises a warning instead of an error? And the program keeps going!


### Why we hate Nim

[Nim][nim] is Python made right. Or it would be‚Ä¶

The big Nim‚Äôs no-no is that you keep bumping into things that don‚Äôt behave as
they told ‚Äì or don‚Äôt work at all.

The Nim‚Äôs line is:

### Why we hate Elixir

[Elixir][elixir] is a toy programming language created because kids can‚Äôt code
in Erlang ‚Äì but Erlang is cool, and they wanna look cool.

[BEAM][beam] is the Erlang‚Äôs virtual machine, and it has a lotta restrictions
that ensure your app isn‚Äôt gonna crash unexpectedly.

At some point in the past, Erlang had become cooler than Ruby, so all cool kids
wanted to code in it, but they aren‚Äôt able to. Bad programmers can‚Äôt deal with
the BEAM‚Äôs restrictions. ü§∑

In order to allow then to work with Erlang, some ~~imbecile~~ developer decided
to work around the BEAM restrictions, obliterating all Erlang advantages ‚Äì but
it‚Äôs still cool. This is Elixir: a workaround to obliterate BEAM advantages.


### Why we hate X

I could keep going on and on, talking about [Javascript][javascript],
[TypeScript][typescript], [Wren][wren], [Odin][odin], [Moonscript][moonscript],
[Lua][lua], [Dart][dart], [C#][c#], [F‚òÖ][f*], and every other noteworthy
programming language, but I think we‚Äôre good here.
