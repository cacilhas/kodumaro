:right ![Itch.io][image]

:first Iâ€™m simply fascinated by indie game development. Itâ€™s free from a bunch
of programming concerns, and allows us to explore new horizons.

Iâ€™m tired of development risks due to **money** â€“ always money! Nothing is more
important in our Capitalist system than money, not culture, not even human
lives; money is in the societyâ€™s kernel, and it leads to a lotta stress. Iâ€™m
really tired of it.

Iâ€™d really take a way out if I find it, and indie game development seems to be
a promising one. Anyway it had never been for me.

Nevertheless, Iâ€™ve been using game development for study and to keep my mind
sharp since ever.

Said that, letâ€™s get into some side projects Iâ€™ve been playing around with. Iâ€™m
not getting into many details, otherwise I couldnâ€™t quote them all. If youâ€™re
looking for more detail about any game or code here, leave a comment. ðŸ˜‰


### Itch.io

IMHO, [Itch.io][] is the best game release platform, and Iâ€™ve been using it as
[my personal showcase][]. Every game weâ€™re talking about in this post you can
find there.


### Scratch games

:right ![Scratch cat][scratch-cat]

Iâ€™m talking about [Scratch][] first to sweep it away, â€™cause Scratch earns its
own whole post.

I think Scratch is a great sandbox to test concepts and the place for sharing
ideas.

I have a Scratch project called [Casual Funny Games][], and we can get into it
in another post. Even on Itch.io I have a [page for it][casual-on-itch].


### TIC-80 games

:right ![TIC-80][tic-80-image]

I love [fantasy consoles][], and my favourite is [TIC-80][]: it has an old home
computer feeling which no other console manages to emulate. Therefore I
recommend purchasing its [payed version][tic-80-on-itch].

Iâ€™ve published some TIC-80 games of my own, all of them developed using
[Moonscript][]:

- [Sokoban][] is a classic among classics! I literally copied every detail from
  the [MSX implementation][msx-sokoban].
- [Arkanoid NG][] is my TIC-80 implementation of the classic [Arkanoid][], one
  of the first breakout games.
- [Missile Command][] is a clone of the
  [Atariâ€™s same-title shootâ€™em up game][atari-missile-command]. Donâ€™t let
  missiles destroy your builds!
- [Kodumaro Tetris][]: who doesnâ€™t known the Russian [Tetris][]!? In here I took
  care of the presentation.

I donâ€™t wanna talk about [this one][snake]â€¦ ðŸ˜’


### Godot Engine games

:right ![Godot Engine][godot-image]

I reckon [Godot Engine][] is the best balanced game engine available:

- Unity 3D is easy and widely used, but lacks security; I wouldnâ€™t recommend.
- Unreal Engine is the most powerful, but requires too much hardware resources
  both to develop and to play games.
- UPBGE is an eternal doubt.
- In GDevelop, simple things become a challenge to be achieved.
- Construct3 and Game Maker are more expensive than they actually deliver, as
  well as so many others.
- Scratch aims for Education, not commercial purposes.

I got some Godot games Iâ€™ve been working on:

- [Standstill][]: a tower-defence game. I created it to test
  [Kenneyâ€™s assets][], which are amazing. This is one of my games Iâ€™m proud of.
- [Catcheese][] is a simple maze game based on [CuteMaze][].
- [Fairy Tale][] intends to be an immersive adventure game, but Iâ€™ve miserably
  failed. Itâ€™s still funny though. ðŸ˜¬
- [Kodumaro Catch Game][] is what it says: a catch game. More precisely a 1D
  catch game (only moves side to side). I made the game in about one hour and
  then I spent my free time during two days trying to catch smoke. It is
  unnecessarily heavyweight, but have some cool details.


### Raylib games

:right ![Ferris the Crab][ferris]

If you need performance, I recommend [Raylib][] with [Rust][].

Raylib is exceptional for 2D games. Not that good for 3D, but still gets the job
done.

- [NanpurÃ«][] is a colourful [sudoku][] â€“ instead of numbers, you got colours.
- [Nonogram][kodumaro-nonogram] is a random implementation for [nonogram][]. It
  doesnâ€™t form meaningful pictures, but has the advantage to be able to be
  played forever.

I have a lot of other [Rust applications][], but only these two games.


### GDevelop games

:right ![GDevelop5][gdevelop5]

I couldnâ€™t leave [GDevelop][] out. It is nothing its authors claim it is:

- Itâ€™s **not easy**.
- Itâ€™s **not no-code**.
- Itâ€™s **not RAD**.

Even so itâ€™s really amusing, I usually have a lotta good time developing in
GDevelop.

I used to have a GDevelop game in Itch.io, [Get Out!][], however it has a very
sad story: its code wasnâ€™t published to any remote repository, and my hard disk
got fried, so I **lost the whole code**. ðŸ˜­

Itâ€™s still [published][Get Out!], but I cannot do any changes anymore.
