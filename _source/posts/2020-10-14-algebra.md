{:class="mg-first"} For a developer to be able to work with Functional
Programming, there are a few concepts he or she must master.

In addition to the [functional constraints][lies], there are two very important
main ideas: algebraic data types (ADT) and algebraic structures. In this post,
we‚Äôre looking at some algebraic structures.

### Functor

Functor is the simpliest algebraic structure. It‚Äôs a wrapper around a datum or
data that can map operations over them and their successful results.

A basic example of functor in [Scala][scala] is
[`scala.util.Try`][scala.util.Try]:

```scala
Try {1 / x}
  .map {e => e*e}
  .map {1 - _}
  .map {_.toString} match {
    case Success(value) => s"the result is $value"
    case Failure(exc)   => s"it raised an exception: $exc"
  }
```

Most of the Scala basic wrappers, like `Seq`/`List`, `Option`, `Either`, etc,
are functors too.

### Monad

[Haskell][haskell]‚Äôs monads have been getting people in dread, but they‚Äôre
nothing than a variation of functor approach.

A monad is a wrapper around a datum or data that can operate over them flatly
mapping the results and possibly describing side-effects.

Our first monad example is the [`Seq`][scala.collection.immutable.Seq]:

```scala
Seq(1, 2, 3)
  .flapMap {e => Seq(e * 2)}
  .flatMap {e => if (e == 2) Nil else Seq(e)}
  .flatMap {e => if (e == 4) Seq(4, 5) else Seq(e)}
```

The result is `Seq(4, 5, 6)`; the `flatMap` method is the main resource of a
monad.

Since `Seq` is a functor too, you may replace the first `flatMap` by a `map`,
and it has a `filter` method, more expressive than `flatMap`:

```scala
Seq(1, 2, 3)
  .map {_ * 2}
  .filter {e != 2}
  .flatMap {e => if (e == 4) Seq(4, 5) else Seq(e)}
```

The result is the same. `List`, `Option`, `Try`, `Either`, etc, are monads too.

The knownest monad is the Haskell‚Äôs [`IO`][IO]. The `IO` monad describes how an
I/O side-effect happens.

For example:

```haskell
greetings :: IO ()
greetings = printStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

The `greetings` function idempotently returns an `IO` monad that can trigger a
writing to the standard output.

### Monoid

A monoid is a structure that supplies an addition operation and an unit
instance for a type.

The monoid definition is:

```scala
trait Monoid[A] {
  def add(a: A, b: A): A
  def unit[A]: A
}
```

Let‚Äôs, for instance, define two monoids for dealing with integer and string
sequences:

```scala
implicit object IntMonoid extends Monoid[Int] {
  def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
  def unit: Int = 0
}

implicit object StringMonoid extends Monoid[String] {
  def add(a: String, b: String): String = a concat b
  def unit: String = ""
}
```

Defined these two monoids, we can code a function that can reduce an integer or
string sequence:

```scala
def reduce[A](xs: Seq[A])(implicit ev: Monoid[A]): A =
  if (xs.isEmpty) ev.unit
  else ev.add(xs.head, reduce(xs.tail))
```

It works like this:

```scala
reduce(Seq(1, 2, 3)) // returns 6
reduce(Seq("Hello", ", ", "World", "!")) // returns "Hello, World!"
```

In order for the `reduce` function to work properly with other types, it‚Äôs
enough to supply another type‚Äôs implicit monoid, for instance a `DoubleMonoid`,
no need for changing the `reduce` function.

> [`Numeric`][scala.math.Numeric]: the addition method is `ev.plus`, and the

### Apply, applicative, semiring, lattice, etc

Other algebraic structures are mostly just variants of these three we‚Äôve just
been through. You can find some definitions in [this glossary][glossary].
