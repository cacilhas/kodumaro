{:class="mg-first"} I was around with a cyclic reference issue in
[Scala][scala]: [JSON][json] representation.

I was using [Gson][gson] for serialising and deserialising (not going in
details), but how to represent the models inside the language ecosystem?

I could follow the Gson documentation and use [pojos][pojo]
([case classes][case-class] are great for it), but I needed something more
flexible.

I decided to use language primitives, like integers, strings, big numbers, and
so one.

So I created some types for deal with that:

```scala
type unroll[+A] = A
type JValue = unroll[_ <: Any]
type JArray = Seq[JValue]
type JObject = String Map JValue
```

Not bad, I can hold complex objects in `JValue` variables:

```scala
val data: JValue = Map(
  "x" -> 3,
  "y" -> 4,
  "name" -> "test",
  "list" -> Seq("zero", 1, 2, 3, true),
)
```

But odd things started to happen, like:

```scala
val element: JValue = <data>This is an XML node</data>
```

It should crash! But doesn‚Äôt, since `NodeSeq` is `Any`‚Äôs subclass.

I needed something stricter.

### Enter Dotty

Now I‚Äôve tried [Scala 3, codename Dotty][dotty].

My first unsuccessful attempt was:

```scala
type JNull = Unit
type JValue = Int | BigDecimal | String | Boolean | JNull | Seq[JValue] | String Map JValue
```

And Dotty put a damper on my plans:

> Illegal cyclic type reference: alias Map[Int | BigDecimal | String | Boolean |
> JNull | Seq[JValue] | String, JValue] of type JValue refers back to the type
> itself.

Then I hit [this strange solution][jasper-m-solution]:

```scala
type Rec[F[_], A] = A match {
  case Int => Int | F[Rec[F, Int]]
  case _ => A | F[Rec[F, A]]
}
```

[Jasper M][jasper-m] is suggesting taking advantage of the Scala
[type erasure][type-erasure] to create a runtime `LazyRef`. So I followed the
advice:

```scala
type JNull = Unit
type JPrimitive = Int | BigDecimal | String | Boolean | JNull

type Rec[JArray[_], JObject[_], A] = A match
  case JPrimitive => JPrimitive | JArray[Rec[JArray, JObject, JPrimitive]] | JObject[Rec[JArray, JObject, JPrimitive]]
  case _          => A          | JArray[Rec[JArray, JObject, A]]          | JObject[Rec[JArray, JObject, A]]

type JValue = Rec[Seq, [A] =>> String Map A, JPrimitive]
```

And *vois la*! It works pretty well!

```scala
// Okay, unit represents null
var x: JValue = ()

// Also okay
x = true

// OMG! Still okay!
x = Map(
  "x" -> 3,
  "y" -> 4,
  "name" -> "test",
  "list" -> Seq("zero", 1, 2, 3, true),
)

// It throws an exception
x = <data>nope</data>

// If -Yexplicit-nulls is enabled, it throws an exception too
x = null
```

Now the `JValue` is quite stricter, and the `WeakRef` made the recursive type
possible.
