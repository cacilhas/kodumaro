:right ![Package Management][image]

:first Something I consider really amazing is the package management idea, used
by open source projects and cannibalised by big techs.

I‚Äôm not talking about programming languages and frameworks, I‚Äôm talking about
operating system package management. It‚Äôs an incredibly good idea.

You can take any [GNU][]/[Linux][], [BSD][], or other open source operating
system, and there you‚Äôll find a package manager.

The idea is so good that proprietary systems started to imitate, by will or not:
[Scoop][], [Homebrew][], and so on.

It has only a *tiny-tiny* issue: every package manager has its own user
interface.

It‚Äôs actually quite annoying to remember which are the command line parameters
for each system. Even through the most similar operating systems, such as
GNU/Linux distros, the differences between managers are big.

Take [Pacman][] and [APT][], by instance.

How to install a package in an Arch Linux based system?

```sh
pacman -S $package_name
```

And in a Debian GNU/Linux based system?

```sh
apt install $package_name
```

I took the two most different tools, but the slightly different ones are even
worse, ‚Äôcause you have to keep remember tiny variations to avoid big mistakes.


### Enter the universal package managers

Some people had the idea of creating universal package managers, in order to put
some order to that chaos.

So you may trip over [Flatpak][], [AppImage][], or, my favourite, [UPT][].

UPT is a real platform-agnostic package manager. I started using it some time
ago, and never stopped (till now).

It‚Äôs enough reliable and stable. If you‚Äôre using virtually any Linux distro, a
BSD distro, macOS with Homebrew, or Windows with a package manager, I highly
recommend it.

UPT **doesn‚Äôt replace** the system package manager, it works on top of it.


### It works until it doesn‚Äôt

Just like anything else, UPT is no bed of roses.

I was using UPT in association to [Rua][], then [Yay][].

When I was still using Rua, I‚Äôd never requested UPT to supported it, after the
Math, Rua isn‚Äôt that popular tool.

However, when I migrated to Yay, I started reckoning it makes no sense to use
two different package manages since Yay is a well known and popular tool.

I took a look at UPT‚Äôs code, and I find it easy to extend it to support Yay, so
I did it, and I uploaded a pull request.

After a copple of weeks, my pull request kept being ignored. That upset me.

Thereat I took a decision of creating my own demi-universal package manager.


### UPT Please had born (to die premature)

I started using the UPT fork I‚Äôve created for my pull request, and performed
some changes in order to differentiate it from UPT, but I didn‚Äôt like it.

UPT code is quite good, but it uses some approaches which I don‚Äôt like (they
aren‚Äôt wrong, it‚Äôs a personal taste), and if I kept it that way, I would be in
trouble supporting it.


### Please Installer at last

So I [rewrote it from scratch][Please Installer]. My first goal was to reproduce
as much as possible UPT features I had used, so I did it.

Now I have a beta version working, and I‚Äôm using it in my systems.

I need more people using though. The more people uses it, the more stable and
reliable I‚Äôll be able to make it.


### Installation

Please Installer requires the nightly version of Rust ‚Äì and it won‚Äôt probable
change. While I‚Äôm writing this, the 2024-09-01 version works fine.

Therefore use the package manager of your system to install `rustup`, then run:

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly-2024-09-01
```

Install Please Install:

```sh
cargo +nightly-2024-09-01 install please-install
```

If you dare, you may wanna install the development version:

```sh
cargo +nightly-2024-09-01 install please-install --git=https://github.com/cacilhas/please.git
```

Please installer supports a [configuration file][], `$HOME/.config/please.toml`.
It‚Äôs not required, but recommended. I suggest the following initial content:

```toml
su = true

[list]
pager = "bat --file-name='installed packages'"

[search]
pager = "bat --file-name='search $args'"
```

Note that it requires `bat`.

Since I use [Arch Linux], *btw*, with [Yay][], my personal settings are:

```toml
assume-yes = true
vendor = "yay"

[remove]
su = true

[list]
pager = "bat --file-name='installed packages'"

[search]
pager = "bat --file-name='search $args'"
```

My son uses Flatpak, and the his settings are:

```toml
vendor = "flatpak"

[list]
pager = "bat --file-name='installed packages'"

[search]
pager = "bat --file-name='search $args'"
```

So you can update your system:

```sh
please update
```


### Using Please Installer

Let‚Äôs find and install Brave Browser:

```sh
please search brave-browser
```

Using Yay, for me it returned the package `chaotic-aur/brave-bin` ‚Äì dependenting
on your system, the package name may be completely different.

So install it:

```sh
please install chaotic-aur/brave-bin
```

And that‚Äôs it.

In order to upgrade it:

```sh
please upgrade brave-bin
```

And to remove it:

```sh
please remove brave-bin
```

List of subcommands:

```sh
please help
```


### Next goals

I still brought the overall approach from UPT code to Please Installer , and now
I realised it won‚Äôt stand. I need to rewrite the code again üôÅ to make it
mantainable.

I have plans to use more traits and put system-bought features into dedicated
modules that can be easily disabled in compiling time.

I wanna create a subcommand to help users to set their installation as well, and
also implement an built-in pager.

There‚Äôs a lot to do, it‚Äôs gonna take some time to get to the point I want, but I
expect to count on community to help testing and using it.

Let‚Äôs see what comes next‚Ä¶
