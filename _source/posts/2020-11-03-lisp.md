{:class="mg-first"} LISP is a specification by [John McCarthy][john-mccarthy],
that has started a whole programming language family since 1958. It‚Äôs based on
[Œª-calculus][Œª-calculus], formal system from [Alonzo Church][alonzo-church]‚Äôs
work in 1930s, designed to deal with symbolic data instead of numeric, most
imperative languages‚Äô standard.

LISP means ‚Äúlist processing,‚Äù and list is the specification main structure.
Every data ‚Äì as the code itself ‚Äì are represented as lists.

For instance, the sum of 1 and 2:

```lisp
(+ 1 2)
```

Which is a list of the elements `+`, `1`, and `2`. This list is processed by the
`car` (head) and `cdr` (tail) functions:

```lisp
(+ . (1 2))
```

`car` and `cdr` are [IBM 704][ibm-704] instructions, the system where LISP was
formost developed. CAR means ‚ÄúContents of the Address part of Register number‚Äù
and CDR means ‚ÄúContents of the Decrement part of Register number.‚Äù

The head represents a lambda function, and the tail the parameters. In this
case, the function is `'+`, which returns the sum of the parameters.

The LISP family most important languages are [Common Lisp][common-lisp],
[Emacs LISP][emacs-lisp], [Scheme][scheme], and [Clojure][clojure].

Let‚Äôs take a look at the factorial implementation in three LISP languages. First
in Common Lisp:

```lisp
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (= n 0)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

In R‚ÅµRS (Scheme):

```scheme
(define factorial
  (lambda (n)
    (if (zero? n)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
```

In Clojure:

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (reduce * (range 1 (inc n))))
```

### Scheme

Scheme has became a family itself, with a lotta different variations, not only
different implementations, but different language variations too.

Its most important variations are [Guile][guile], [MIT Scheme][mit-scheme], and
[Racket][racket] (formerly PLT Scheme).

Racket is a full [RAD][rad] platform, containing an IDE called
[DrRacket][drracket], WYSIWYG interface builder called [MrEd Designer][mred],
and the PLT interpreter.

The interpreter supports [R‚ÅµRS][r5rs], [R‚Å∂RS][r6rs], [PLT][plt],
[Lazy Racket][lazy-racket], and even [C][c].

For example, the factorial in Racket:

```scheme
!#racket

(define factorial
  (Œª (n)
    [if (zero? n)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))]))
```

The hash-bang line tells which language Racket must deal with:

- R‚ÅµRS: `#!r5rs`
- R‚Å∂RS: `#!r6rs`
- PLT: `#!racket`
- Lazy Racket: `#!lazy`
- C: `#!planet jaymccarthy/c`

### Accumulators

Accumulator is a functional programming design pattern for dealing with stack
overflow by taking advantage of [tail-call optimisation][tco] (TCO).

Let‚Äôs take the factorial again: the step is defined as the current value times
its predecessor‚Äôs factorial; the stop is zero‚Äôs factorial, which equals one.

```
n! = n √ó (n-1)!
0! = 1
```

If you take a look at the PLT implementation above, you can see the last call
id `'*`; in order to enable TCO, it should be `factorial`.

It must exist an accumulator-driven function to make it possible, so the
`factorial` becomes:

```scheme
(define factorial
  (Œª (n)
    *factorial* n 1))
```

The accumulator-driven version (`*factorial*`) must receive the original
parameter and the accumulator, returning the accumulator when it stops:

```scheme
(define *factorial*
  (Œª (n acc)
    [if (zero? n)
      acc
      (*factorial* (- n 1) (* acc n))]))
```

Note that now the last call is `*factorial*`, enabling the TCO.

### Lazy evaluation

The most efficient approach to deal with huge calculated data volumes is
[lazy evaluation][lazy-evaluation], or call-by-need. [Haskell][haskell], for
instance, just evaluates its calls by demand, which enables to build infinite
lists:

```haskell
fib :: [Integer]
fib = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fib (tail fib)
```

Than on can take only how many elements one needs:

```haskell
take 10 fib
```

### Promises

[Lazy Racket][lazy-racket] uses promises to delay the evaluation, in a similar
taste as Haskell.

The evaluation of a lazy function is made by the function `'!!`.

So the lazy factorial is:

```scheme
#!lazy

(provide factorial)

(define *factorial*
  (Œª (n acc)
    [if (zero? n)
      acc
      (*factorial* (- n 1) (* acc n))]))

(define factorial
  (*factorial* n 1))
```

And one can evaluate it by calling:

```scheme
(!! [map (Œª (n) `(,n ,(factorial n))) '(0 1 2 3 4 5)])
```

The result is:

```scheme
'((0 1) (1 1) (2 2) (3 6) (4 24) (5 120))
```
