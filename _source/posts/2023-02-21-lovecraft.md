:first A platform I simply love is [Scratch][]. You can build different kinds of
application using a visual programming based on drag’n’drop blocks.

Recently I’ve been working on a Lovecraftian game quite simple, where you just
need to find a key using a sensor, while running away from an *oni*-style demon. I
call it “Must Find the Key to Escape” (not the most creative name, I know).

I based the code on a
<a href="{{{griffpatch}}}" target="_blank"><code>@griffpatch</code></a>’s
[ray-casting series][], and a [simple sound tutorial][] from [The STEAMist][].

You can play the game at [Itch.io][].
