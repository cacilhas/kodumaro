Kodumaro [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/kodumaro) has been deactivated, and we’re going [Mastodon](https://social.sndevs.com/@kodumaro) now!

[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) is a microblog kinda like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). Its head difference from Twitter though is that Mastodon is **federated**, it means, there’s no central service. There are lots of servers talking to each other, each one following its own rules, so nobody can own the network.

We’d like to invite you to get in. You can do it by signing up one of the servers listed [here](https://joinmastodon.org/servers).

I created my personal account in [Stranger.Social](https://stranger.social/), but I believe [FOSStodon](https://fosstodon.org/) could be a good choise as well.

You can find us searching for [`@kodumaro@social.sndevs.com`](https://social.sndevs.com/@kodumaro).
