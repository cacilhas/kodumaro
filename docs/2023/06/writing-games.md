Iâ€™m simply fascinated by indie game development. Itâ€™s free from a bunch of programming concerns, and allows us to explore new horizons.

Iâ€™m tired of development risks due to **money** â€“ always money! Nothing is more important in our Capitalist system than money, not culture, not even human lives; money is in the societyâ€™s kernel, and it leads to a lotta stress. Iâ€™m really tired of it.

Iâ€™d really take a way out if I find it, and indie game development seems to be a promising one. Anyway it had never been for me.

Nevertheless, Iâ€™ve been using game development for study and to keep my mind sharp since ever.

Said that, letâ€™s get into some side projects Iâ€™ve been playing around with. Iâ€™m not getting into many details, otherwise I couldnâ€™t quote them all. If youâ€™re looking for more detail about any game or code here, leave a comment. ðŸ˜‰

### Itch.io

IMHO, [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) is the best game release platform, and Iâ€™ve been using it as [my personal showcase](https://cacilhas.itch.io/). Every game weâ€™re talking about in this post you can find there.

### Scratch games

![Scratch cat](//cacilhas.info/img/scratch-cat.png)

Iâ€™m talking about [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) first to sweep it away, â€™cause Scratch earns its own whole post.

I think Scratch is a great sandbox to test concepts and a good place to share ideas.

I have a Scratch project called [Casual Funny Games](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30951170), and we can get into it in another post. Even on Itch.io I have a [page for it](https://cacilhas.itch.io/casual-funny-games).

### TIC-80 games

![TIC-80](//cacilhas.info/img/tic80.png)

I love [fantasy consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console), and my favourite is [TIC-80](http://tic80.com/): it has an old home computer feeling which no other console manages to emulate. Therefore I recommend purchasing its [payed version](https://nesbox.itch.io/tic80).

Iâ€™ve published some TIC-80 games of my own, most of them developed using [Moonscript](https://moonscript.org/):

*   [Sokoban](https://cacilhas.itch.io/sokoban) is a classic among classics! I literally copied every detail from the [MSX implementation](https://msxgamesworld.com/software.php?id=1518).
*   [Arkanoid NG](https://cacilhas.itch.io/arkanoid-ng) is my TIC-80 implementation of the classic [Arkanoid](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/0000255), one of the first breakout games.
*   [Missile Command](https://cacilhas.itch.io/missile) is a clone of the [Atariâ€™s same-title shootâ€™em up game](https://www.arcade-history.com/?page=detail&id=1644). Donâ€™t let missiles destroy your builds!
*   [Kodumaro Tetris](https://cacilhas.itch.io/tetris): who doesnâ€™t known the Russian [Tetris](https://tetris.com/)!? In here I took care of the presentation.

I donâ€™t wanna talk about [this one](https://cacilhas.itch.io/snake)â€¦ ðŸ˜’

### Godot Engine games

![Godot Engine](//cacilhas.info/img/godot.png)

I reckon [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) is the best balanced game engine available:

*   Unity 3D is easy and widely used, but lacks security; I wouldnâ€™t recommend.
*   Unreal Engine is the most powerful, but requires too much hardware resources both to develop and to play games.
*   UPBGE is an eternal doubt.
*   In GDevelop, simple things become a challenge to be achieved.
*   Construct and Game Maker are more expensive than they actually deliver, as well as so many others.
*   Scratch aims for Education, not commercial purposes.

I got some Godot games Iâ€™ve been working on:

*   [Standstill](https://cacilhas.itch.io/standstill): a tower-defence game. I created it to test [Kenneyâ€™s assets](https://kenney.nl/assets), which are amazing. This is one of my games Iâ€™m proud of.
*   [Catcheese](https://cacilhas.itch.io/catcheese) is a simple maze game based on [CuteMaze](https://gottcode.org/cutemaze/).
*   [Fairy Tale](https://cacilhas.itch.io/fairy-tale) intends to be an immersive adventure game, but Iâ€™ve miserably failed. Itâ€™s still funny though. ðŸ˜¬
*   [Kodumaro Catch Game](https://cacilhas.itch.io/catch-game) is what it says: a catch game. More precisely a 1D catch game (only moves side to side). I made the game in about one hour and then I spent my free time during two days trying to catch smoke. It is unnecessarily heavyweight, but have some cool details.

### Raylib games

![Ferris the Crab](//cacilhas.info/img/ferris-the-crab.png)

If you need performance, I recommend [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Raylib is exceptional for 2D games. Not that good for 3D, but still gets the job done.

*   [Nanpure](https://cacilhas.itch.io/nanpure) is a colourful [sudoku](https://sudoku.com/) â€“ instead of numbers, you got colours.
*   [Nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) is a random implementation for [nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram). It doesnâ€™t form meaningful pictures, but has the advantage to be able to be played forever.

I have a lot of other [Rust applications](https://crates.io/users/cacilhas), but only these two games.

### GDevelop games

![GDevelop5](//cacilhas.info/img/gdevelop.png)

I couldnâ€™t leave [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) out. It is nothing its authors claim it is:

*   Itâ€™s **not easy**.
*   Itâ€™s **not no-code**.
*   Itâ€™s **not RAD**.

Even so itâ€™s really amusing, I usually have a lotta good time using GDevelop.

I used to have a GDevelop game in Itch.io, [Get Out!](https://cacilhas.itch.io/get-out), however it has a very sad story: its code wasnâ€™t published to any remote repository, and my hard disk got fried, so I **lost the whole code**. ðŸ˜­

Itâ€™s still [published](https://cacilhas.itch.io/get-out), but I cannot do any changes anymore.
