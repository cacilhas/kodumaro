A platform I simply love is [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). You can build different kinds of application using a visual programming based on drag’n’drop’ping blocks.

Recently I’ve been working on a Lovecraftian game quite simple, where you just need to find a key using a sensor, while running away from a oni-style demon. I call it “Must Find the Key to Escape” (not the most creative name, I know).

I based the code on a [`@griffpatch`](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/griffpatch/)’s [ray-casting series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1c5TcdITVs), and a [simple sound tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v99RKhePxw8) from [The STEAMist](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ThePhantomAnimator/).

You can play the game on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/806344631/) or on [TurboWarp](https://experiments.turbowarp.org/pointerlock/806344631).
